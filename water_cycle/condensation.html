        <h1>Condensation</h1>
        <p>Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase,
           and is the reverse of vaporization. The word most often refers to the water cycle. It can
           also be defined as the change in the state of water vapor to liquid water when in contact with
           a liquid or solid surface or cloud condensation nuclei within the atmosphere. When the transition 
           happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly, the change is called deposition.<br>
           <br>


           Initiation
            Condensation is initiated by the formation of atomic/molecular clusters of that species within its 
            gaseous volume—like rain drop or snow flake formation within clouds—or at the contact between such 
            gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface. In clouds, this can be catalyzed by water-nucleating 
            proteins, produced by atmospheric microbes, which are capable of binding gaseous or liquid water 
            molecules.<br>
            <br> 
            
            Reversibility scenarios
            A few distinct reversibility scenarios emerge here with respect to the nature of the surface.<br>
            <br>
            1. Absorption into the surface of a liquid (either of the same substance or one of its solvents)—is 
               reversible as evaporation.<br>
               <br>
            2. Adsorption (as dew droplets) onto solid surface at pressures and temperatures higher than the 
               species' triple point—also reversible as evaporation.<br>
               <br>
            3. Adsorption onto solid surface (as supplemental layers of solid) at pressures and temperatures lower 
               than the species' triple point—is reversible as sublimation. </p>
